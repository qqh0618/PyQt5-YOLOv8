## Update
- 2024/02/12 Project Initialize
- 2024/02/13 demo over

## 二、 Introduction

As a mature project, YOLOv8 does not have a complete GUI, and the structure of YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 projects is very different. Therefore, this project draws on the excellent YOLOv5 pyqt project and then conducts secondary development to implement YOLOv8 GUI
## 三、Note
- Only tested image detection and video detection
- After importing videos or images, you need to click the play button to detect them (which will be modified later)
- Please provide more opinions on the areas that are not perfect
